            "\n",
            "An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. Here are the key points about arrays:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Basic Characteristics:\n",
            "- Fixed size (in most programming languages)\n",
            "- Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations\n",
            "- Elements are accessed using an index (starting from 0)\n",
            "- All elements must be of the same data type\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Advantages:\n",
            "- Fast access to elements using index\n",
            "- Efficient memory usage\n",
            "- Simple to implement\n",
            "- Good for sequential access\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Disadvantages:\n",
            "- Fixed size (cannot grow or shrink)\n",
            "- Insertion and deletion can be expensive\n",
            "- Wastage of memory if size is not known in advance\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Common Operations:\n",
            "- Accessing elements\n",
            "- Traversing\n",
            "- Searching\n",
            "- Insertion\n",
            "- Deletion\n",
            "- Sorting\n",
